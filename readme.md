#### Project Ideas

**Mental Health in Tech**: [Survey on Mental Health in the Tech Workplace in 2014](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey) & ["Ongoing" from 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016)

1. Is there a significant difference between perceived attitudes regarding mental health, between the data from 2014 and the data from 2016?

1. Is there any evidence from this data set that there are more negative perceived attitudes towards certain mental health conditions? Certain genders or ages?
